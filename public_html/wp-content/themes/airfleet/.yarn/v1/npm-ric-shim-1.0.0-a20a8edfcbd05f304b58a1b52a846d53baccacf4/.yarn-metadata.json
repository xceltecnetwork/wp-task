I want to use it in my projects and install it from npm.\n\nI was going to write a shim that would fallback to a simple `setTimeout` only to find that the awesome [Paul Lewis](https://twitter.com/aerotwist) had [already done this](https://gist.github.com/paullewis/55efe5d6f05434a96c36).\n\nBut in addition to shimming it for browser use, I also wanted it to not break code if used from within node.js (falls back to `setTimeout`).\n\nSo... here we are.\n\nI simply wrapped/published it for compatibility with npm-based frontend projects and changed it to not blow up if used in a node environment where `window` obviously won't be defined. Instead it simply checks to see if `requestIdleCallback` exists and uses it if it's there.\n\nI didn't even write any tests!?!! The audacity! Yeah, I know. Deal with it. Or don't and use something else.\n\nAll credit for the actual fallback code goes to [Paul Lewis](https://twitter.com/aerotwist). The original license is retained in a `NOTICE` file in my best efforts to comply with the original licensing. If I'm doing this wrong, just tell me and please love me despite my many flaws.\n\n## install\n\n```\nnpm install ric-shim\n```\n\n## example\n\n```javascript\nimport requestIdleCallback from 'ric-shim'\n\nrequestIdleCallback(() => {\n  // do your thang!\n})\n```\n\nOr if you're not into the fancy-pants ES6+ modules thing:\n\n```javascript\nvar requestIdleCallback = require('ric-shim')\n\nrequestIdleCallback(function () {\n  // do your thang!\n})\n```\n\n## what about cancelling?\n\nYeah, you probably won't need it, but in case you do that's exported too, as a property of the main export:\n\n```javascript\nimport requestIdleCallback, { cancelIdleCallback } from 'ric-shim'\n\n// do a thing!\nconst id = requestIdleCallback(doSomething)\n\n// just kidding, nevermind\ncancelIdleCallback(id)\n```\n\nOr node-style:\n\n```javascript\nvar requestIdleCallback = require('ric-shim')\nvar cancel = requestIdleCallback.cancelIdleCallback\n\n// do a thing!\nvar id = requestIdleCallback(doSomething)\n\n// just kidding, nevermind\ncancel(id)\n```\n\n## credits\n\nIf you like this sort of stuff and think there may be something to this whole \"web thing\" you may want to follow [@HenrikJoreteg](http://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg) on twitter. Or you may not. That's ok too.\n\n## license\n\n[MIT](http://mit.joreteg.com/)\n",
